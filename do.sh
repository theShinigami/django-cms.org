_usage() {
    cat <<USAGE
Convenience wrapper around docker-compose.

Usage:

    ${BOLD}bounce${NORMAL}

        Tear down, rebuild and stand up all Docker containers (handy when you switch branches)

    ${BOLD}build${NORMAL}

        Builds all the images (or the ones specified) for running

    ${BOLD}check${NORMAL}

        Validate Django settings

    ${BOLD}compose${NORMAL}

        Minimal wrapper around docker-compose, just ensures the correct config files are loaded.

    ${BOLD}djshell${NORMAL}

        Opens a Django shell

    ${BOLD}exec${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Execute a command in a container

    ${BOLD}makemigrations${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Create a new Django migration, using the given args

    ${BOLD}migrate${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Apply any unapplied Django migrations

    ${BOLD}pip-compile${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        This will re-compile the python requirements from the current requirements.in file
        This is good to do if you add a new requirement, but don't want to upgrade any others when compiling requirements.txt
        https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools#pip-tools--pip-compile--pip-sync

    ${BOLD}pip-upgrade${NORMAL}

        This will re-compile the python requirements from the current requirements.in file while also including the upgrade flag.
        Therefore requirements.txt will be generated with newer versions of packages which aren't pinned

    ${BOLD}shell${NORMAL}

        Opens a bash terminal in web

    ${BOLD}showmigrations${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Show all relevant Django migrations, optionally scoped by the given args

    ${BOLD}start${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Start the django server (and dependent services)
        You can pass `-d` for running detached.

    ${BOLD}stop${NORMAL} [<arg>]

        Stop the django server (and dependent services)
